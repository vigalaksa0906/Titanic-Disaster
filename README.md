# Titanic-Disaster
Using the Titanic dataset, I developed a model to categorize passengers by survival status based on multiple factors. The project tackled issues like dataset imbalance by implementing balancing techniques. This research enhanced my machine learning skills and offered valuable experience in addressing practical data challenges.
